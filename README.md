# gods -> Go data strcutures
Implements data structures in go

Evolving design
We will build series of data structures in Evolving design, 
each implementation will use the existing data structure implmentation as the building block, 
we will enhance this cover this.
Evolution of programming language, impact on software
Understand usage of generic(s)
Need for concurrency primitves, usage example(s)
Marriage of data structures, concurrency role of concurrency primitves in 

Lets build
and create a series of article(s) and blog(s)

Add approach note(s), bring a design touch
trade of(s), how expensive/complicated it can be

Building and neat and clean software, consistenet design.

Stateful design - advantage(s), disadvantage(s)

DRY KISS YAGNI

Do not repeat your self, Keep it simple stupid, 

KISS -> Keep it simple stupid
